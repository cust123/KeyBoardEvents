# Keyboard Events with Details

This project demonstrates how to capture and display detailed information about keyboard events in a web page. Users can press any key, and the project will display the pressed key, its keyCode, and its code in a table format.

## Getting Started

There are no specific software prerequisites to run this project. You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see it in action.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Press any key on your keyboard. A table will appear inside the designated area, displaying details about the pressed key.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page structure and linking to CSS and JavaScript.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the page elements.
- `custom.js`: The JavaScript file containing the code that handles keyboard events and displays the information.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The markup language used to structure the content of the web page.
- CSS: The stylesheet language used to define the visual presentation of the web page.
- JavaScript: The scripting language used to add interactivity to the web page.

## Project Features

- **Keyboard Event Capture:** The project captures the "keydown" event and retrieves information about the pressed key.
- **Detailed Key Information Display:** The project displays the pressed key, its keyCode (a legacy property representing the physical key location), and its code (a more modern property representing the logical key value) in a table format.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing (based on the styles in `style.css`).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The project provides a clear and intuitive interface with a designated area for displaying key information.
